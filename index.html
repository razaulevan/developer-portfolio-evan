                <h3 class="orange-color">2005-Present | pro level dancer</h3>
                <p>Definition of Dance and Its Genres Essay. Dancing is an art that refers to the movements of body
                    parts
                    and especially to rhythmic and to music. Dancing is taken as a form of nonverbal communication that
                    is
                    used to express emotions, ideas or tell a story. Dances are social, participatory or performed for
                    an
                    audience.</p>

                <h1>Beautiful singer</h1>
                <h3 class="orange-color">1997-present | strong voice</h3>
                <p> If I could write about one thing and one thing only, I would write about singing. I know many people
                    who
                    sing whether they actually have talent or not, but singing is my true passion; it is not just
                    something
                    I do in my spare time or just another accomplishment to check off of the list of things I can do,
                    but
                    rather it is something that has true meaning to me. I dare say that it is the most important thing
                    to me
                    in my life besides God and my family.</p>
